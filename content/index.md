## about me

I am a Mechanical Engineer by training and I work in Manufacturing Automation for the semiconductor industry. By habit, I drift toward robotics, automation, and systems that sit awkwardly between hardware and software. I care about how things are made, how they fail, and how to make life just a little bit sexier everyday.

This attempt aspires to be the snapshot of my life since my brain needs to gamify journaling. This site is a running log of what I’m building, breaking, and learning. Some of it works. All of it teaches me something and most of it keeps me from doing chores.

## my problem statements

1. **Decentralized Manufacturing - General Integrated infrastructure for Robotics**
	- Manufacturing robotics systems are fragmented across vendors, software stacks, and data standards. This makes scaling, reconfiguration, and cross-site learning expensive and brittle.  
	- The problem is building a **general, vendor-agnostic infrastructure** that allows robots, PLCs, vision systems, and AI models to interoperate, learn, and deploy consistently across distributed manufacturing environments.
2. **Introduction of blockchain to mainstream finance** 
	- Despite strong cryptographic guarantees, blockchain systems remain largely unusable in everyday finance due to latency, regulatory friction, and poor abstraction layers for end users.  
	- The core problem is **bridging trustless systems with regulated financial workflows** without sacrificing usability, auditability, or compliance.
	- Also since payment processors tried to f with steam I think the world is due to be free from this moral policing. [Watch this video if youre interested in finding out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEflTJjtn5w)
3. **Complete automation of my home - A project on human intent prediction**
	- Most “smart homes” rely on explicit commands, rigid rules, or manual automation scripts, which do not scale with human behavior.  
	- The problem is designing a home system that **infers human intent from context, behavior, and uncertainty**, and acts autonomously while remaining predictable and controllable. More on this to be written soon. 
	- I want to create an Indian version of Jarvis. His name is Birju
4. **Unsustainable Consumerism and Non-Repairable Products**
	- Modern consumer products are optimized for short lifespans through design choices that discourage repair, reuse, and long-term ownership. This creates economic lock-in, unnecessary waste, and technical debt at a societal scale.  
	- The problem is designing **products, standards, and business models** where long-term repairability, modularity, and ownership are not optional features but structural requirements that make predatory, disposable practices economically unsustainable.
5. **Human Longevity as an Engineering Problem**
	- Human lifespan is currently constrained by aging processes that are poorly modeled, weakly monitored, and treated reactively rather than systemically. Most interventions focus on disease management instead of longevity optimization.  
	- The problem is reframing **human life extension as an engineering challenge**: measuring biological degradation, modeling aging as a failure process, and designing interventions that extend healthy function indefinitely rather than merely delaying decline.
6. Traffic Police in Navi Mumbai / Mumbai.
	- Even if I was to ignore the corruption, urban traffic enforcement in Mumbai relies heavily on manual monitoring, inconsistent rule application, and reactive intervention. This results in congestion, unsafe driving, and low public trust. Absolute incompetence can be assumed as soon as you see a white uniform cop in Mumbai.
	- *Enforcement where enforcement is easy*

### What tomorrow looks like for me

- My goal in life is to bring change in this world. I want to create something that every human being on this planet will use, value and most importantly - pay for. (fair costs obviously)

- I want to enable the children in my country - India, to all get the same opportunity at life that I had the privilege of having. For that, I aspire to build all that it takes to create infrastructure, culture and ecosystems that enable kids to first *fafo*, then worry about staying alive and then, finally aspiring to come work with me towards a bigger goal than what I can foresee as of today (but am sure to have tomorrow)
