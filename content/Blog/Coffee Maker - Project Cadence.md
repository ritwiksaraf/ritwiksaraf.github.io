## Problem Statement

I want to build the coffee maker that would make me coffee when i want how i want it and without me asking me to do it. Also i don't want a lot of prep time for the coffee maker - Kinda set it and forget it and look at it once a month deal.

next I plan to do the material design and prototype design first. Hope to keep this blog updated!
Been at it for almost a decade now. i will try and find the photos but my first ( failed ) attempt at this was back in India when i connected a relay with an ESP device straight to the wall and tried to turn on the coffee machine with a telegram chat bot. it worked but solved for almost nothing
